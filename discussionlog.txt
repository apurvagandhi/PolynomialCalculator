Assignment 4


Discussion Log: 
I mostly worked with Margaret on equal product and linked list implementation as queue.cc. Furthermore, I talked with Kelly about the algorithm for evaluate function. We discussed few ways to get to the answer. Finally, I discussed with Christian about the copy constructor and how to change functions from stack class to the function we can use in queue class for linked list. I have worked with Margaret on many of the concepts and we tried to figure out various challenging codes through visiting professor's office hours. I have not discussed about this project with anyone else other than people mentioned above.
